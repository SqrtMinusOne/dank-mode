** External libraries

These libraries are not part of Emacs 25.

- dash.el (GPLv3) https://github.com/magnars/dash.el (ELPA)
- s.el (GPLv3) https://github.com/magnars/s.el (MELPA)
- request.el (GPLv3) https://github.com/tkf/emacs-request (MELPA)

** Ideas

- Use plstore.el for oauth tokens
- Use web-server.el to do the oauth dance
  http://eschulte.github.io/emacs-web-server
- Custom Emacs distribution with dank-mode bundled (paid?)
** Known bugs
*** dank-posts-mode
